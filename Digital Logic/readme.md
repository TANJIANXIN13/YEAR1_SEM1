<h3 align="left">ðŸ’¡ Reflection</h3>

###

<p align="left">This course lays the groundwork for understanding how digital systems operate at the hardware level. The study of number systems and logic gates helps me to understand how data is represented and manipulated. Boolean algebra and logic simplification teach techniques for optimizing circuit designs, which is essential for building efficient and reliable systems. Combinational logic circuits are fundamental for performing arithmetic and decision-making operations, while sequential circuits like latches, flip-flops, counters, and shift registers show how data can be stored, processed, and timed in real-world applications</p>
