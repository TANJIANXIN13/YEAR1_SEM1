<p align="left">In this subject, I have a better understanding to ICT's foundational and emerging aspects. It highlights the importance of staying updated with emerging technologies like AI, IoT, and cloud computing. <br><br>In PC assemble lab, I get better understanding to hardware of PC components. Besides, I have learn how to handle hardware safely, install components correctly, and ensure proper connections between them. It really enhancing problem-solving skills and gaining hands-on experience that improve my confidence in assembling PC.<br><br>In assignment 1, I learned that ICT has become an essential part that covers the majority of the industry, which enables the company to manage and store big data, analyze the behavior of the customers, and make decisions. The insights gained from this talk encourage further exploration of ICT careers in airline or other<br>industries, highlighting their potential to give meaningful change in any industry.<br><br>In assignment 2, we had visit to the UTM digital. This industry visit is very important to us because it gives us a different and unique experience that we have never had before. It is also useful to let us know how they work and operate. Besides that, through these activities we gained a deeper understanding of the core content of the course. For example, when discussing the development of the blockchain. During the visit, we had the opportunity to experience some innovative technologies such as touch board teaching tools. This interactive experience made us interested in learning about these technologies and made us realize the great potential of technology in the field of education. In addition, after visiting the organization and attending the talk, we realized that learning by combining theoretical knowledge with practice is more effective.<br><br>In assignment 3, I have a plan to be hardworking in the next four years, not only to improve and strengthen my hard skills like coding and debugging but also to learn some soft skills abilities like the way to communicate with others and problem-solving skills. By setting clear goals, I will always spot my weaknesses and try to improve them and dig deep into my interests and needs to find an industry and type of job that I like once I graduate.<br><br>In design thinking project, it enhances my ability to define the problems and find out the best solution to solve the challenges. Furthermore, it gives me a chance to collaborate and socialize with others to improve my communication skills.</p>
